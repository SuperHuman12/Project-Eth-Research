# Ethereum-Research
This is a personal note taking research for understanding EIP protocols and usecases by implementing them.

///

# Topics of research & implementation:**


 0. EIP 20 : to simply create an **ERC20 token** 

 1. **Generate an ENS sub-account** securely for members  (will require ENS SDK or API)

 2. EIP 721 **assetization of items**, like invoices, and debts.

 3. EIP 3386 : to **convert an asset such as invoice and buying partial ownership** to reduce risk.

 4. Setup Swap , **Integrate with AMM & Metamask**   (can easily be accomplished using zapier api)
