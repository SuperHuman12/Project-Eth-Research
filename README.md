This is a personal note taking research for understanding EIP protocols and usecases by implementing them.



Topics of research & implementation:


0. Generate an ENS sub-account securely 

1. EIP 721 assetization of items, like invoices, and debts.

2. EIP 3386 : to convert an asset such as invoice and buying partial ownership to reduce risk.

3. EIP 20 : to simply create an ERC20 token

4. Setup Swap , Integrate with AMM & Metamask
